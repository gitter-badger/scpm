Context has already happen. It is the situation that leads to the risk.

The risk did not occur yet, that is the situation that we want to avoid (unless the situation happen, in that case this is a problem)

<p><%= label_tag 'probability' %>
<%= select :risk, :probability, Risk::PROBABILITY %><br/>
Are we sure the risk will happen ?<br/>
2 is a normal level risk, we must follow it carefully so that it does not happen, so we must have some actions already<br/>
1 is less sure than 2. It could still happen, but the situation is still pretty good so that the risk do not occur. No need to define action.<br/>
3 we are pretty sure the risk will occur. This is bad. We must act now, we still have a chance to avoid it<br/>
0 is for a risk that we avoided completely already.<br/>
4 is for a risk we did not prevent, it is now an issue. In that case a corrective action must be done to reduce impact (if not already done).<br/>

What situation we will be if the risk occur and what impact this will have on our business

<%= select :risk, :impact, Risk::IMPACT %><br/>
How bad the impact will be.<br/>
1 is low. In general this is a risk we don't care too much about.<br/>
2 is medium. We have to follow it and we should plan preventive actions.<br/>
3 is bad for the project. This is serious and we have to take actions.<br/>
4 is very bad for our business. This could lead to the project stop.<br/>
